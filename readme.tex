%% If you want to define a new command, you can do it like this:
\newcommand{\Q}{\mathbb{Q}}
\newcommand{\R}{\mathbb{R}}
\newcommand{\Z}{\mathbb{Z}}
\newcommand{\C}{\mathbb{C}}

%% If you want to use a function like ''sin'' or ''cos'', you can do it like this
%% (we probably won't have much use for this)
% \DeclareMathOperator{\sin}{sin}   %% just an example (it's already defined)
